# Zero-Inflation Problem: Comprehensive Paper Collection ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Zero-Inflation Problem Paper Collection**, a curated repository of academic papers and resources covering diverse approaches to tackle zero-inflated data issues in various domains. This collection is your go-to resource for understanding, analyzing, and advancing zero-inflation research.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Zero-inflated data appears frequently in fields such as climate science, healthcare, and social sciences, posing challenges for predictive modeling and statistical analysis. This repository provides a comprehensive set of papers addressing the problem through:

- Statistical models (e.g., Zero-Inflated Poisson, Hurdle Models)
- Machine learning solutions
- Deep learning innovations
- Application-specific approaches (e.g., rainfall prediction, count data analysis)

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

1. **Statistical Methods**
   - Overview of traditional zero-inflation models
   - Hurdle models, Zero-Inflated Poisson, Tweedie distribution

2. **Machine Learning Approaches**
   - Supervised and unsupervised methods
   - Feature engineering for zero-inflated data

3. **Deep Learning for Zero-Inflated Data**
   - Transformer-based models
   - Custom loss functions (e.g., Tweedie loss, weighted loss)

4. **Applications**
   - Climate data (e.g., rainfall prediction)
   - Healthcare data (e.g., rare disease modeling)
   - Social sciences (e.g., survey data analysis)
